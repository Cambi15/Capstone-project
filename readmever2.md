## Finding the best Toronto neighborhood to open a new gym

# 1. Introduction
# 1.1. Background
# Toronto is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) proper had a 2016 population of 6,417,516. Toronto is an international center of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.
## Demographics data
# The demographics dataset contains 1538 rows and 140 columns. The rows represent the demographics information for the 140 neighborhoods. The data that I found related to this problem is the total population, the youth age, the number of the educated population, and the number of employers. These data were selected only from the demographic dataset. The reason for choosing these data only is the relevance to the problem. The total population is an important feature as the total population increase, it means the availability of more customers. The target customers are the youth and the adults, in the age range of 15 to 45 years, that’s why the population in this age range will be calculated. The educated and employed population are more expected to care about their health and fitness and are expected to go to the gyms/ fitness centers.
## The geographical data
# The geographical dataset was not available alone, but I found it in the crime rate dataset. First, I extracted the geographical information for each neighborhood. The latitudes and longitudes were saved as a list of strings, so they had first to be cleaned from the commas and brackets and then convert the list of strings into floats and finally to merge it with the demographic’s dataset
## Methodology
# Since the main problem is finding the best neighborhoods to open a new gym, so this problem can be seen as an unsupervised learning problem. Unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that through mimicry, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world. Since we try to group the neighborhoods that are the best to open new gyms together this method can be seen as a clustering problem. K-means clustering method is used to cluster the data. k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
## Result
# When observing the neighborhoods in each cluster, The first cluster has 34 neighborhoods and they have a large population, 15–45 aged population, employed and educated population, a moderate number of venues, and a small number of gyms.
# The second cluster has 71 neighborhoods, and they have a small population, a small number of venues, and a small number of gyms per neighborhood.
# The third cluster has 35 neighborhoods, it has a small population, but the highest number of venues and number of gyms per neighborhood.
## Conclusion
# Using the demographics data and venue information for each neighborhood obtained from Foursquare API, I was able to cluster the neighborhoods into three clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm. The number of gyms was found to be correlated to the number of venues, and the neighborhoods with a large number of venues and gyms are clustered into the third cluster, so the most suitable neighborhood out of this cluster is the “Trinity-Bellwoods” neighborhood. The first cluster contains a neighborhood with a large population and a small number of gyms and a moderate number of venues. The “Church-Yonge Corridor” neighborhood is the best choice out of this cluster as it contains 98 venues and a large population. The number of venues is almost similar to that of the “Trinity-Bellwoods” and the population is double of it, making it the best neighborhood to open a new gym in Toronto city.
# It is important in the future to study the type of venues that are related to the number of gyms and also the price of the land and the rents of the commercial building in the neighborhoods in the first and third clusters to be able to select the most suitable neighborhood.
